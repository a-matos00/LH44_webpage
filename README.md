<h2>Description: </h2>
This is a project that I did while learning responsive web design on freeCodeCamp.org. This is the first project that
needs to be completed in order to get the certification. The task is to build a simple tribute webpage using HTML/CSS/JS.

<h2>Features:</h2>

<h3>Mandatory:</h3>
-The website must be responsive which means that it adjusts for desktop and mobile devices.
-It must contain: a title, an image and a text which contains informatio about the subject and a link that leads to 
another page.

<h3>Bonus</h3>
-I added a button for dark mode. It's position is set to sticky so it sticks in one place and is always avaliable to
the user while he scrolls on the page.

<h2>Important note</h2>
 The website is not fully polished. My main goal was to practice what I learned so I didn't pay much attention to the
 tidiness of the code or the naming of elements or variables. I will surely come back to it and perfect it after I
 finish the last "Responsive web design" project on freeCodeCamp.org.
